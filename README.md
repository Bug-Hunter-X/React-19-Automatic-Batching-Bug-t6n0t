This repository demonstrates a bug in React 19 related to automatic batching of updates. The bug manifests when asynchronous operations and complex state updates are combined, resulting in unexpected behavior. The solution showcases a method to mitigate this issue by using `useReducer` for state management or explicitly flushing updates using `ReactDOM.unstable_batchedUpdates`.  The bug.js file contains the problematic code, while bugSolution.js provides the solution.
